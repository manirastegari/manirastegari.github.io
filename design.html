                <p>
                    In this project, I designed an animal adoption website. The page has a database with the animals 
                    of the different shelters where you can find your ideal pet. The idea was to create an application that 
                    encourages the adoption of animals instead of buying them, spreading the word about the animals 
                    that are up for adoption and making the process easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To locate and define more precisely how this project was carried out, a previous study was made on 
                    the state of the matter, as well as an analysis of existing similar products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to carry out the project in an efficient and organized manner, I planned, using a <strong>Gantt Chart</strong>, 
                    the tasks to be carried out each month until the delivery of the project on June 1, 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <strong>SWOT analysis</strong> was also carried out, bringing together the main positive and negative internal 
                    and external factors that condition the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <strong>Business Model Canvas</strong> was also drawn up to show the key elements from the company's point of view. 
                    It was important for this project to carry out a Business Model Canvas as to clarify the most 
                    relevant ideas and aspects such as target customers, value proposition, revenue streams and cost structure. 
                    By visually representing these elements on a single canvas, it's easier to see how they interrelate 
                    and fit together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do the <strong>market research</strong> I first defined the product and the target audience. The selected product 
                    is a digital tool for animal adoption and the target audience, people, of all genders, between 18 
                    and 60 years old, who live in the province of Barcelona and who want to adopt in an animal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conducting <strong>surveys</strong> is also a good method to gather important information. The target audience 
                    selected are adults aged 18 to 60 who have or have had pets. A total of 104 people participated. I also 
                    conducted 2 <strong>interviews</strong> with the President of the Animalist Platform Sant Cugat and the secretary 
                    of the Protectora de Montcada dogs and cats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2 <strong>user personas</strong> were defined and a <strong>Customer Journey Map</strong> was created, a method that consists of a 
                    graphic representation of how users feel about the service at each moment of the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To visually reproduce and shape the ideas before designing and programming, <strong>wireframes</strong> were made, 
                    low-fidelity by hand and high-fidelity with Figma, of the different screens that would be displayed 
                    in the interface and organize the content that was later tested with users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prototype of the application was modified on the basis of the observations collected in the 
                    test carried out with users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Technologies used:</strong> Figma, Canva
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Project Duration:</strong> 6 months
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Overview:</strong> This project consists of a UI/UX design of a website prototype to facilitate animal adoption. I
                    did research of the current trends in design and carried out the entire process of creating a
                    web design from planning and user testing to the final prototype.
